Create a Next.js app.

```bash
npx create-next-app --ts
```

Create a `src` directory at the project's root. Move `pages` and `styles` into `src`.

Install Prettier and the Prettier ESLint config npms.

```bash
npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

Install Prettier VSCode extension.

Add a `.prettierrc.json` file:

```json
{
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

Followed instructions here: https://vampiro.github.io/dev/docs/ for setting up husky for pre-commit hook Prettier formatting.

# Auth

Follow instructions for installing `next-auth` and adding the nextauth api endpoint and login/out component. https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth

Follow instructions for setting up your OAuth provider: https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth-provider

To configure in Google go here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials. This involves setting up the origin and redirect urls inside Google. Should add localhost for development. Eventually add your Vercel domain.

Save off your client id and client secret into a `.env.local` file in your project.
