# Random docs of things I need to remember

## Docusaurus

These docs were generated by Docusaurus.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

- Follow docusaurus.config.js setting instructions for deployment: https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/deployment.
- Copy/paste the action from here: https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action into your_project/.github/workflows/deploy.yml.
- Check the action to make sure it's relevant to you (paths, build, etc.). It was fine out of the box for docusaurus hosted at root level of project.
- Push your docs into GitHub. This will create a `gh-pages` branch from the deploy action.
- Enable GitHub Pages for your site. Project -> Settings -> GitHub Pages, Select `gh-pages` branch.
